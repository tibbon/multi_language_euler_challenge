# Multi Language Euler Challenge

I know Ruby and JavaScript. But I'd like to learn MORE LANGUAGES. So how better than to do several at once using the problems from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

## Languages

I already know Ruby and JavaScript, so I'll frequently use those to initially figure out a solution to the problem and then figure out implementation in other languages. 

The languages I'll attempt to complete each in: 

* Ruby 2.1/MRI
* JavaScript/CoffeeScript
* C
* Haskell
* Clojure/ClojureScript
* Go

Additional languages may be added at a later time. I'd like to learn all I can this way.
